# MUST READ

tl;dr The project is now outdated.

This project started as a custom hotel application, but currently I'm busy with bigger projects with much more relevance so this has to be on HOLD.

It'll be continued in the future and while you're here reading this, me and my buddy achieved the following:

- Login / registration. Includes Google SSO and standart registration / login.
- Creating reservations and checking the busy dates.
- Custom date picker that provided the days where you could not reserve the room.
- Paypal integration with successful and cancelled reservation endpoints.
- Seamless communication between the Front-End and Back-End using the RESTful APIs.

Bare in mind, the project started as a regular ReactJS application and later was migrated to NextJS.

The stack included: NextJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, C# .NET, AWS.

Huge s/o to @ShakaMirtskhulava for working on this project with me.
